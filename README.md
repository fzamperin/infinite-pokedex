# Pokedex Infinite Scroll

This project demonstrates an implementation of an infinite scroll list of Pok√©mon using TypeScript, the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and also the [Intersection Observer Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). The goal is to build the infinite scroll mechanism from scratch and paginate the API requests.

The project also has a state management using [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx).

## Getting Started
  

To set up the app locally, run the following commands:

```bash
$  yarn  install
$  yarn  dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the project in the browser.

## Project Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a build tool and development server for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
